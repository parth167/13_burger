## Steps to Follow

- Eat-Da-Burger! is a restaurant app that lets users input the names of burgers they'd like to eat.
- Whenever a user submits a burger's name,app will display the burger on the left side of the page -- waiting to be devoured.
- Each burger in the waiting area also has a `Devour it!` button. When the user clicks it, the burger will move to the right side of the page. App will store every burger in a database, whether devoured or not.

1. This app is hosted on Heroku and does not use an external database, so the JSON file that stores the notes is reset every time the server resets.
